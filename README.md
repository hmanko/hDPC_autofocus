# hDPC_autofocus

The files required for environment will be uploaded soon...
The UserManual is currently under modification.

This is repository containing the code, GUI and other required files for autofocusing procedure described in article "Nanoscale drift-correction in high-resolution optical microscopy for non-transparent biological tissues using back-illumination label-free imaging" which was submitted for publication.

The folder LEDcontrol contains the last version of the code used to controll the acquistions performed as a part of the project. 

! The Transstition_microscopeControl folder contains old code that was used to control acquisitions on a commercial NikonTi microscope equipped with a Phasics QPI camera. Note that this code was not updated to the object-oriented version, so I am keeping it here as an example that may be useful to someone.

User manual describes the procedure of installation, devices configuration and control of the autofocusing system. Two separate forlders contain GUI file generated by Qt5-tools designer and the main script for application with trans- and back-illumination modalities.
